ðŸ“ŸThese are all of the reports and most multisim files I have done with my friends for the **Digital Technology Course** for my university studies.ðŸ“Ÿ

## Tasks:
### Based only on NAND gates we were supposed to make a circuit which would display emojis according to a specific number (each number corresponded to one emoji)

### Four bit counter counting through Fibbonacci numbers

### A simple CD player which would have a few buttons:
* STOP
* PLAY
* NEXT
* PREVIOUS
